## Data Flow

The system operates with the following data flow:

1. Raw HTS tape manufacturing data is collected from sensors during the manufacturing process
2. The Data Processing Module preprocesses this data, calculates dynamic uniformity metrics, and applies PCA
3. The Neural Fitted Q-Iteration Controller is trained on this processed data
4. The trained controller generates optimized process parameters
5. The Real-time Monitoring Dashboard visualizes both the original and optimized parameters
6. Feedback from the optimization is used to adjust the manufacturing process

## Key Technologies

### 1. Dynamic Uniformity Modeling

The system implements a dynamic uniformity modeling approach that calculates the coefficient of variation (CV) of critical current using a moving window. This provides a localized measure of uniformity along the tape, which is more informative than global metrics.

```python
def calculate_dynamic_cv(critical_current, position, window_size, step_size):
    cv_values = []
    window_positions = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(position) - int(window_size / step_size)):
        start_idx = i
        end_idx = i + int(window_size / step_size)
        
        window_slice = critical_current[start_idx:end_idx]
        std_dev = np.std(window_slice)
        mean_val = np.mean(window_slice)
        
        if mean_val > 0:
            cv = std_dev / mean_val
            cv_values.append(cv)
            window_positions.append(position[start_idx])
    
    return np.array(window_positions), np.array(cv_values)
```

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the process parameters while preserving the most important information. This addresses the collinearity problem in process parameters and makes the optimization more tractable.

```python
def apply_pca(data, n_components, variance_threshold):
    # Standardize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
    
    # Apply PCA
    pca = PCA(n_components=n_components)
    pca_result = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)
    
    # Determine number of components based on variance threshold
    explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
    cumulative_variance = np.cumsum(explained_variance)
    n_components_threshold = np.argmax(cumulative_variance >= variance_threshold) + 1
    
    return pca_result[:, :n_components_threshold], pca, explained_variance
```

### 3. Neural Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQ)

The system implements Neural Fitted Q-Iteration with artificial neural networks to optimize the manufacturing process parameters. This reinforcement learning approach learns the optimal control policy by iteratively improving a Q-function approximated by a neural network.

```python
def train_nfq(states, actions, rewards, next_states, epochs, batch_size):
    # Build Q-network
    q_model = build_q_network(state_dim, action_dim)
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Generate training batch
        inputs, targets = generate_training_batch(
            states, actions, rewards, next_states, batch_size)
        
        # Train model
        q_model.fit(inputs, targets, verbose=0, batch_size=batch_size)
    
    return q_model
```

### 4. Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for monitoring the manufacturing process, visualizing critical current and uniformity metrics, and applying optimization suggestions.

## Performance Metrics

The system's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Predictive Accuracy**: Measured by the accuracy of the CV prediction model
2. **Uniformity Improvement**: Quantified by the reduction in CV after optimization
3. **Dropout Reduction**: Measured by the decrease in critical current dropout events
4. **Manufacturing Efficiency**: Overall improvement in the manufacturing process
